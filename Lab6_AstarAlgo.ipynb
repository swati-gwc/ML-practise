    "A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections. \n",
